Write a function, sublist, that takes in a list of numbers as the parameter. In the function, use a while loop to return a sublist of the input list. The sublist should contain the same values of the original list up until it reaches the number 5 (it should not contain the number 5).
def sublist(x):
    new_list =[]
    i = 0
    while i < len(x):
        if x[i] == 5:
            break
        else:
            new_list.append(x[i])
            i = i +1
    return new_list
sublist([1,2,3,4,5])


Write a function called check_nums that takes a list as its parameter, and contains a while loop that only stops once the element of the list is the number 7. What is returned is a list of all of the numbers up until it reaches 7.
def check_nums(x):
    new_list = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(x):
        if x[i] == 7:
            break
        else:
            new_list.append(x[i])
            i = i+1
    return new_list
check_nums([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
